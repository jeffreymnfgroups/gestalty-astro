    tagline: "The Organized Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts"
    core_principle: In learning, it means connecting knowledge pieces into complete understanding where you're equipped to apply, analyze, and create.
    what_it_does: Transforms fragmented study efforts—scattered notes, random revisions, disconnected practice—into unified mastery systems where every learning action contributes to deep understanding through pattern recognition and unit-based learning.
    why_it_matters: When you see the bigger picture, individual concepts become meaningful and retention soars. Gestalt learning moves you from memorization to mastery.

    tagline: "You become unstoppable when your learning is yours."
